# Version Control using Git

## What is Git?
- Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. 
- It allows multiple developers to collaborate, manage different versions of a project, and maintain a history of changes. 
- Git ensures efficiency, reliability, and flexibility in software development workflows.
